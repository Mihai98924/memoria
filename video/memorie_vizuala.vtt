We all have photographic memories, it's just
that some of us don't have any film.

2
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.680
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews.

3
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.070
One of my favorite book series as a kid was
about kid detective Cam Jansen, who by saying

4
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.439
“click” could snap a picture in her head
and be able to remember the scene like she

5
00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.550
was looking at a photograph.

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.439
Just like Cam Jansen, though, photographic
memory seems to be a work of fiction. There’s

7
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.430
a limit to the kind of information we can
take it at once. We remember certain details

8
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.440
of a scene, but not EVERY detail. Like if
I try to think of the painting of the Girl

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.910
with the Pearl Earring, I can kind of remember
what her earring looks like, but I couldn’t

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.230
for the life of me tell you what color her
eyes are.

11
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.069
Little kids often have something close, though,
called eidetic memory. This is when kids can

12
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.220
recall an image in extreme detail for a few
minutes after they’ve seen it. But because

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.050
most people lose this ability as they grow
up some scientists think it’s an immature

14
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.540
version of memory. As kids grow up and learn
to read and write and think abstractly, memory

15
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.830
becomes more abstract too.

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.650
Yeah there are some examples of people with
REALLY good memory. Stephen Wiltshire comes

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.180
about as close as possible to being a human
camera. After just a short helicopter ride,

18
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.810
he was able to recreate the skyline of New
York to almost near accuracy. Of course, he

19
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.430
is an artist, so he took some creative liberties.
But no serious scientific research confirms

20
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.310
his abilities.

21
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.920
While that’s just one maybe example, there
are other cases of people will really good

22
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.890
memories. Like really good. One famous case,
the story of Jill Price who remembers nearly

23
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.280
everyday of her life was published in the
journal Neurocase. She remembers everything

24
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.090
about her life, down to what shirt she wore
to Target to buy groceries on a certain day.

25
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.850
Although her abilities might be the result
of a kind of OCD where she obsesses over memories.

26
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.669
Which doesn’t sound all that fun.

27
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.920
Another study published in the journal of
Neurobiology of Learning and Memory looked

28
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.020
at the brains of eleven participants who might
have similar memories. Scientists referred

29
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.390
to this ability as Highly Superior Autobiographical
Memory (HSAM). While they performed pretty

30
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
average on some cognitive tests, the researchers
found that their brains were actually unique.

31
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.419
They had stronger white matter connections,
which could allow information to be transferred

32
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.910
more efficiently in the brain.

33
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.680
But the participants didn’t use memory palaces
or other tricks. The scientists found that

34
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920
“Instead, they appear to have some inherent
ability to retain and retrieve vast amounts

35
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.920
of public and autobiographical events, well
beyond what one may expect from simple rehearsal.”

36
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.220
What kind of rehearsal you ask? Well, mind
palaces seem to be the best way to boost your

37
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.310
memory. If you’ve ever seen BBC’s Sherlock
Holmes, you know what this looks like. Pick

38
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.670
a scene you’re familiar with like walking
down your street or walking around your house

39
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.760
and put things you want to remember in a certain
spot. Like if I wanted to remember pi i could

40
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.739
put the 3 on my front door, I could put the
.14 on the wall in my foyer. I could put the

41
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.390
15 on my banister I could put the 92 at the
top of stairs. you get the idea, as I mentally

42
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.540
walk through my house, I would associate those
numbers with those locations. A lot of memory

43
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.720
champions use this trick.

44
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.849
While photographic memory doesn’t seem real
and most of us don’t have special memories,

45
00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.899
thank God because I would really hate to re-live
every embarrassing day of middle school, there

46
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.880
are ways to improve your memory. Like the
mind-palace trick or Trace says to sniff some

47
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.450
rosemary or maybe make a fist! No really,
check it out in this video here or check out

48
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.799
why we forget things at all, check out this
video here.

49
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.800
